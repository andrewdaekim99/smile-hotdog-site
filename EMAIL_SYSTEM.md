## How It Works

### 1. **Order Placement**

When a customer places an order (either logged-in or guest), the system:

1. Creates the order in the database
2. Creates order items
3. Updates customer points (if logged-in)
4. **Automatically sends confirmation email**

### 2. **Email Generation**

The email system:

1. Generates HTML and plain text versions
2. Includes all order details
3. Uses professional styling with Korean Fusion branding
4. Sends via Supabase's email service

### 3. **Email Delivery**

- Uses Supabase Auth's built-in email functionality
- Sends to the customer's email address
- Includes both HTML and plain text versions
- Subject line: "Order Confirmation #[OrderID] - Korean Fusion Food Truck"

## Technical Implementation

### **Email Service**

Currently uses **Supabase Auth's built-in email functionality**:

- No additional email service setup required
- Uses your existing Supabase configuration
- Reliable and secure

### **Fallback Options**

The system is designed to easily integrate with other email services:

## Testing

### **Test Page**

Visit `/test-order-email` to test the email functionality:

## Production Considerations

### **Email Service Upgrade**

For production use, consider upgrading to a dedicated email service:

#### **Recommended: Resend**

```bash
npm install resend
```

Add to `.env.local`:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

Update `src/lib/email.js` to use Resend:

```javascript
import { Resend } from "resend";

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export async function sendEmailViaResend(to, subject, html, text) {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
      from: "Korean Fusion <orders@koreanfusion.com>",
      to: [to],
      subject: subject,
      html: html,
      text: text,
    });

    if (error) {
      console.error("Resend email error:", error);
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Email sending error:", error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### **Email Templates**

- Current templates are inline HTML
- Consider using a template engine for more complex emails
- Templates can be customized for different order types

### **Email Tracking**

For production, consider adding:

- Email delivery tracking
- Open rate monitoring
- Click tracking (if including links)
- Bounce handling

## Customization

### **Email Content**

Edit `src/lib/email.js` to customize:

- Email subject lines
- Email content and formatting
- Business contact information
- Pickup instructions
- Branding elements

### **Styling**

The email template uses inline CSS for maximum compatibility:

- Colors match Korean Fusion brand (#EA9841, #1D4E1A)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Professional typography and spacing

### **Localization**

To support multiple languages:

1. Create language-specific email templates
2. Add language detection logic
3. Update email content based on customer preferences

## Troubleshooting

### **Emails Not Sending**

1. Check Supabase email settings
2. Verify environment variables
3. Check console for error messages
4. Test with the test page

### **Email Formatting Issues**

1. Test in different email clients
2. Check HTML validation
3. Verify CSS compatibility
4. Test plain text version

### **Spam Filtering**

3. Avoid spam trigger words
4. Monitor delivery rates

## Security Considerations
